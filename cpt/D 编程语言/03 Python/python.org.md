The Python Tutorial 教程

p是一个简单去了解, 功能强大 编程语言
Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. 
他是有效率的高级数据结构和 简单但是高效方法去面向对象的编程语言
It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. 
p是优雅的语法和动态类型,一起和他的可解释性, 使他是一个理想语言 对于脚本处理 和 快速的应用开发 在许多领域在大多数平台
Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.

Python解释器和大量的标准库是自由获取的 在源码或二进制 从为了所有主流平台从python网站,也许自由分散. 类似的网站也包含部分的和指向大量的第三方python模块,程序和工具,和附加文档
The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.
python解释器是易于拓展和新函数和数据类型应用在C/C++(或其他语言从C调用).python是也适合 作为拓展语言 为定制应用程序
The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.
本教程向读者非正式地介绍Python语言和系统的基本概念和功能。有一个便于动手体验的Python解释器是有帮助的，但所有的例子都是独立的，所以教程也可以离线阅读。

Whetting Your Appetite 刺激你的食欲
如果你做很多工作在计算机上, 最后你寻找这里是一些任务你想经自动化. 比如,你可能希望执行一个搜索和更新在上面一个大号的文本文件, 或者重命名和重新排序一大批图片文件用复杂的方法. 或许你喜欢写一个小定制数据库, 或者一个特殊的图形应用程序, 或者一个简单的游戏.
If you do much work on computers, eventually you find that there’s some task you’d like to automate. For example, you may wish to perform a search-and-replace over a large number of text files, or rename and rearrange a bunch of photo files in a complicated way. Perhaps you’d like to write a small custom database, or a specialized GUI application, or a simple game.

如果你是一个职业软件开发者, 你不得不去工作用几个C/C++/Java库 但是寻找常用的写/编译/测试/重新编译 周期下来是太慢的.
If you’re a professional software developer, you may have to work with several C/C++/Java libraries but find the usual write/compile/test/re-compile cycle is too slow. 
或许你写一个测试套件对于这样的库并且发现写测试代码一个乏味的任务.或者你已经写了一个程序可以使用拓展语言, 你不想去设计和实现一整个新的语言对你的应用程序
Perhaps you’re writing a test suite for such a library and find writing the testing code a tedious task. Or maybe you’ve written a program that could use an extension language, and you don’t want to design and implement a whole new language for your application.

python仅仅是语言对于你
Python is just the language for you.

你可以写一个unix shell脚本或者windows batch文件对一些任务, 但是shell脚本是最好的在移动文件周围和改变文本数据, 不太适合 对于图形应用程序或者游戏.
You could write a Unix shell script or Windows batch files for some of these tasks, but shell scripts are best at moving around files and changing text data, not well-suited for GUI applications or games. 

你可以写CC++Java程序,但是它会花费大量开发时间去得到甚至第一稿程序. python简单易用, 可以获得在WindowsMacOS,并且Unix操作系统, 并且将帮助你得到工作完成更快的.
You could write a C/C++/Java program, but it can take a lot of development time to get even a first-draft program. Python is simpler to use, available on Windows, macOS, and Unix operating systems, and will help you get the job done more quickly.

python是简单地使用, 但是它是真正的编程语言,提供非常多结构和支持为大型程序比shell脚本或批处理文件提供的.另一方面,python也提供非常多错误检查比C,成为一个非常高级语言,它有高级数据类型内置,比如灵活的数组和字典.因为它更通用数据类型,适合去一个非常大问题范围比Awk或者Perl, 也许多事情是至少变得简单用python在这些语言中.
Python is simple to use, but it is a real programming language, offering much more structure and support for large programs than shell scripts or batch files can offer. On the other hand, Python also offers much more error checking than C, and, being a very-high-level language, it has high-level data types built in, such as flexible arrays and dictionaries. Because of its more general data types Python is applicable to a much larger problem domain than Awk or even Perl, yet many things are at least as easy in Python as in those languages.

python允许你去分割你程序在模块 可以重复使用在另一个python程序. 它来跟一个大集合标准模块你可以使用作为基础你程序 或者作为例子去开始了解去程序用python. 一些模块提供文件读写,系统调用,套接字和甚至接口用户界面接口工具包类似TK.
Python allows you to split your program into modules that can be reused in other Python programs. It comes with a large collection of standard modules that you can use as the basis of your programs — or as examples to start learning to program in Python. Some of these modules provide things like file I/O, system calls, sockets, and even interfaces to graphical user interface toolkits like Tk.

python是一个解释型语言, 可以节省你大量时间在程序开发期间因为没有编译和链接是必须的. 解释器可以使用交互式, 使他变得容易尝试语言的特性, 去写一次性程序, 或者去测试函数在期间自下而上程序开发. 它也是方便的桌面计算器.
Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary. The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it easy to experiment with features of the language, to write throw-away programs, or to test functions during bottom-up program development. It is also a handy desk calculator.

python能够让编程书写紧凑和可读. 程序书写用python是典型的非常短比典型的CC++Java程序,有几个原因:
Python enables programs to be written compactly and readably. Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:
    高级数据类型允许你去表达复杂操作用单个语句
    the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;
    语句分组是完成的 通过缩进代替开始和结束的括号
    statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;
    没有变量或者变量声明是必要的
    no variable or argument declarations are necessary.

python是可拓展的: 如果你知道如何去编程用C他是容易去添加一个新内置函数或模块向解释器, 不论去执行关键行动在最高速, 还是去链接python程序库 可能仅仅获得二进制从(比如一个供应商特定的图形库).一旦你上瘾了,你可以链接python解释器在一个应用程序写用C 使用它作为一个拓展或命令语言对这些应用程序
Python is extensible: if you know how to program in C it is easy to add a new built-in function or module to the interpreter, either to perform critical operations at maximum speed, or to link Python programs to libraries that may only be available in binary form (such as a vendor-specific graphics library). Once you are really hooked, you can link the Python interpreter into an application written in C and use it as an extension or command language for that application.


顺便一说,语言命名是以BBC展示的飞行马戏团 没关系爬行动物. 制作参考资料用Monty python幽默在文档中不仅是允许的,也是鼓励的.
By the way, the language is named after the BBC show “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” and has nothing to do with reptiles. Making references to Monty Python skits in documentation is not only allowed, it is encouraged!

现在你是激动的关于python, 你将想要去检查他在许多细节. 最好的方式去了解语言就是去使用它, 教程邀请你去使用python解释器 在你阅读时
Now that you are all excited about Python, you’ll want to examine it in some more detail. Since the best way to learn a language is to use it, the tutorial invites you to play with the Python interpreter as you read.

在下一章, 使用解释器的机器被解释. 这是相当单调的信息, 但是必不可少尝试的例子展示在后面
In the next chapter, the mechanics of using the interpreter are explained. This is rather mundane information, but essential for trying out the examples shown later.

其余部分 教程介绍各种特点功能语言和系统 通过例子, 开始是简单表达, 语句和数据类型, 穿过函数和模块, 最后接触高级概念像异常和用户自定义类.
The rest of the tutorial introduces various features of the Python language and system through examples, beginning with simple expressions, statements and data types, through functions and modules, and finally touching upon advanced concepts like exceptions and user-defined classes.

Using the Python Interpreter
2.1. Invoking the Interpreter

The Python interpreter is usually installed as /usr/local/bin/python3.12 on those machines where it is available; putting /usr/local/bin in your Unix shell’s search path makes it possible to start it by typing the command:

python3.12

to the shell. [1] Since the choice of the directory where the interpreter lives is an installation option, other places are possible; check with your local Python guru or system administrator. (E.g., /usr/local/python is a popular alternative location.)

On Windows machines where you have installed Python from the Microsoft Store, the python3.12 command will be available. If you have the py.exe launcher installed, you can use the py command. See Excursus: Setting environment variables for other ways to launch Python.

Typing an end-of-file character (Control-D on Unix, Control-Z on Windows) at the primary prompt causes the interpreter to exit with a zero exit status. If that doesn’t work, you can exit the interpreter by typing the following command: quit().

The interpreter’s line-editing features include interactive editing, history substitution and code completion on systems that support the GNU Readline library. Perhaps the quickest check to see whether command line editing is supported is typing Control-P to the first Python prompt you get. If it beeps, you have command line editing; see Appendix Interactive Input Editing and History Substitution for an introduction to the keys. If nothing appears to happen, or if ^P is echoed, command line editing isn’t available; you’ll only be able to use backspace to remove characters from the current line.

The interpreter operates somewhat like the Unix shell: when called with standard input connected to a tty device, it reads and executes commands interactively; when called with a file name argument or with a file as standard input, it reads and executes a script from that file.

A second way of starting the interpreter is python -c command [arg] ..., which executes the statement(s) in command, analogous to the shell’s -c option. Since Python statements often contain spaces or other characters that are special to the shell, it is usually advised to quote command in its entirety.

Some Python modules are also useful as scripts. These can be invoked using python -m module [arg] ..., which executes the source file for module as if you had spelled out its full name on the command line.

When a script file is used, it is sometimes useful to be able to run the script and enter interactive mode afterwards. This can be done by passing -i before the script.

All command line options are described in Command line and environment.
2.1.1. Argument Passing

When known to the interpreter, the script name and additional arguments thereafter are turned into a list of strings and assigned to the argv variable in the sys module. You can access this list by executing import sys. The length of the list is at least one; when no script and no arguments are given, sys.argv[0] is an empty string. When the script name is given as '-' (meaning standard input), sys.argv[0] is set to '-'. When -c command is used, sys.argv[0] is set to '-c'. When -m module is used, sys.argv[0] is set to the full name of the located module. Options found after -c command or -m module are not consumed by the Python interpreter’s option processing but left in sys.argv for the command or module to handle.
2.1.2. Interactive Mode

When commands are read from a tty, the interpreter is said to be in interactive mode. In this mode it prompts for the next command with the primary prompt, usually three greater-than signs (>>>); for continuation lines it prompts with the secondary prompt, by default three dots (...). The interpreter prints a welcome message stating its version number and a copyright notice before printing the first prompt:

python3.12
Python 3.12 (default, April 4 2022, 09:25:04)
[GCC 10.2.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>

Continuation lines are needed when entering a multi-line construct. As an example, take a look at this if statement:
>>>

the_world_is_flat = True

if the_world_is_flat:

    print("Be careful not to fall off!")


Be careful not to fall off!

For more on interactive mode, see Interactive Mode.
2.2. The Interpreter and Its Environment
2.2.1. Source Code Encoding

By default, Python source files are treated as encoded in UTF-8. In that encoding, characters of most languages in the world can be used simultaneously in string literals, identifiers and comments — although the standard library only uses ASCII characters for identifiers, a convention that any portable code should follow. To display all these characters properly, your editor must recognize that the file is UTF-8, and it must use a font that supports all the characters in the file.

To declare an encoding other than the default one, a special comment line should be added as the first line of the file. The syntax is as follows:

-*- coding: encoding -*-

where encoding is one of the valid codecs supported by Python.

For example, to declare that Windows-1252 encoding is to be used, the first line of your source code file should be:

-*- coding: cp1252 -*-

One exception to the first line rule is when the source code starts with a UNIX “shebang” line. In this case, the encoding declaration should be added as the second line of the file. For example:

#!/usr/bin/env python3
-*- coding: cp1252 -*-

Footnotes
On Unix, the Python 3.x interpreter is by default not installed with the executable named python, so that it does not conflict with a simultaneously installed Python 2.x executable.

The Python Standard Library

While The Python Language Reference describes the exact syntax and semantics of the Python language, this library reference manual describes the standard library that is distributed with Python. It also describes some of the optional components that are commonly included in Python distributions.

Python’s standard library is very extensive, offering a wide range of facilities as indicated by the long table of contents listed below. The library contains built-in modules (written in C) that provide access to system functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise be inaccessible to Python programmers, as well as modules written in Python that provide standardized solutions for many problems that occur in everyday programming. Some of these modules are explicitly designed to encourage and enhance the portability of Python programs by abstracting away platform-specifics into platform-neutral APIs.

The Python installers for the Windows platform usually include the entire standard library and often also include many additional components. For Unix-like operating systems Python is normally provided as a collection of packages, so it may be necessary to use the packaging tools provided with the operating system to obtain some or all of the optional components.

In addition to the standard library, there is an active collection of hundreds of thousands of components (from individual programs and modules to packages and entire application development frameworks), available from the Python Package Index.

## Introduction

https://docs.python.org/3/library/intro.html
Introduction

The “Python library” contains several different kinds of components.

It contains data types that would normally be considered part of the “core” of a language, such as numbers and lists. For these types, the Python language core defines the form of literals and places some constraints on their semantics, but does not fully define the semantics. (On the other hand, the language core does define syntactic properties like the spelling and priorities of operators.)

The library also contains built-in functions and exceptions — objects that can be used by all Python code without the need of an import statement. Some of these are defined by the core language, but many are not essential for the core semantics and are only described here.

The bulk of the library, however, consists of a collection of modules. There are many ways to dissect this collection. Some modules are written in C and built in to the Python interpreter; others are written in Python and imported in source form. Some modules provide interfaces that are highly specific to Python, like printing a stack trace; some provide interfaces that are specific to particular operating systems, such as access to specific hardware; others provide interfaces that are specific to a particular application domain, like the World Wide Web. Some modules are available in all versions and ports of Python; others are only available when the underlying system supports or requires them; yet others are available only when a particular configuration option was chosen at the time when Python was compiled and installed.

This manual is organized “from the inside out:” it first describes the built-in functions, data types and exceptions, and finally the modules, grouped in chapters of related modules.

This means that if you start reading this manual from the start, and skip to the next chapter when you get bored, you will get a reasonable overview of the available modules and application areas that are supported by the Python library. Of course, you don’t have to read it like a novel — you can also browse the table of contents (in front of the manual), or look for a specific function, module or term in the index (in the back). And finally, if you enjoy learning about random subjects, you choose a random page number (see module random) and read a section or two. Regardless of the order in which you read the sections of this manual, it helps to start with chapter Built-in Functions, as the remainder of the manual assumes familiarity with this material.

Let the show begin!
Notes on availability

    An “Availability: Unix” note means that this function is commonly found on Unix systems. It does not make any claims about its existence on a specific operating system.

    If not separately noted, all functions that claim “Availability: Unix” are supported on macOS, which builds on a Unix core.

    If an availability note contains both a minimum Kernel version and a minimum libc version, then both conditions must hold. For example a feature with note Availability: Linux >= 3.17 with glibc >= 2.27 requires both Linux 3.17 or newer and glibc 2.27 or newer.

WebAssembly platforms

The WebAssembly platforms wasm32-emscripten (Emscripten) and wasm32-wasi (WASI) provide a subset of POSIX APIs. WebAssembly runtimes and browsers are sandboxed and have limited access to the host and external resources. Any Python standard library module that uses processes, threading, networking, signals, or other forms of inter-process communication (IPC), is either not available or may not work as on other Unix-like systems. File I/O, file system, and Unix permission-related functions are restricted, too. Emscripten does not permit blocking I/O. Other blocking operations like sleep() block the browser event loop.

The properties and behavior of Python on WebAssembly platforms depend on the Emscripten-SDK or WASI-SDK version, WASM runtimes (browser, NodeJS, wasmtime), and Python build time flags. WebAssembly, Emscripten, and WASI are evolving standards; some features like networking may be supported in the future.

For Python in the browser, users should consider Pyodide or PyScript. PyScript is built on top of Pyodide, which itself is built on top of CPython and Emscripten. Pyodide provides access to browsers’ JavaScript and DOM APIs as well as limited networking capabilities with JavaScript’s XMLHttpRequest and Fetch APIs.

    Process-related APIs are not available or always fail with an error. That includes APIs that spawn new processes (fork(), execve()), wait for processes (waitpid()), send signals (kill()), or otherwise interact with processes. The subprocess is importable but does not work.

    The socket module is available, but is limited and behaves differently from other platforms. On Emscripten, sockets are always non-blocking and require additional JavaScript code and helpers on the server to proxy TCP through WebSockets; see Emscripten Networking for more information. WASI snapshot preview 1 only permits sockets from an existing file descriptor.

    Some functions are stubs that either don’t do anything and always return hardcoded values.

    Functions related to file descriptors, file permissions, file ownership, and links are limited and don’t support some operations. For example, WASI does not permit symlinks with absolute file names.
