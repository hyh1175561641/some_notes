Let me hurt some feelings while I have a minute!
No one owes you are your family anything; nor is it the local government's responsibility to support you during trying times like this! Sink or swim it's your choice! The City and County, along with power providers or any other service owes you NOTHING! I'm sick and tired of people looking for a damn handout! If you don't have electricity you step up and come up with a game plan to keep your family warm and safe. If you have no water you deal without and think outside of the box to survive and supply water to your family. If you are sitting at home in the cold because you have no power and are sitting there waiting for someone to come rescue you because your lazy is direct result of your raising! Only the strong will survive and the weak will parish. Folks God has given us the tools to support ourselves in times like this. This is sadly a product of a socialist government where they feed people to believe that the FEW will work and others will become dependent for handouts. Am I sorry that you have been dealing without electricity and water; yes! But I'll be damned if I'm going to provide for anyone that is capable of doing it themselves! We have lost sight of those in need and those that take advantage of the system and meshed them in to one group! Bottom line quit crying and looking for a handout! Get off your ass and take care of your own family!
Bottom line-DONT A PART OF PROBLEM, BE A PART OF THE SOLUTION!




让我在我有空的时候, 来伤害一些人的感情吧! 政府没有责任在这样艰难的时刻支持你, 生或者死是你自己的选择, 我已经厌倦了那些整天伸手要东西的人. 如果你没有电, 就该站起来, 为保护家人制定一个行动计划. 如果你没有水, 自己去想办法跳出框架去生存. 如果你坐在家里只想着别人来救你, 那你懒惰的结果, 直接反映了你从小受的教育, 只有强者才能生存, 弱者会灭亡, 上帝赐予了我们自我支撑的工具, 可悲的救灾是社会主义的结果, 他让人们相信少数人努力工作, 而其他人就该依赖救济, 我为你们没有水和电而感到抱歉, 但我绝对不会去养活那些有能力自己解决问题的人, 我们已经混淆了那些真正需要帮助的人和那些利用系统的人, 别再哭诉了, 别再伸手要救济了, 站起来照顾好自己的家庭, 不要成为问题的一部分, 而要成为解决方案的一部分.











# 12-23 I have a dream


英文原文
I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.
Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of bad captivity.
But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.
In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the "unalienable Rights" of "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked "insufficient funds."
But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.
We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.
It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.
But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.
The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom.
We cannot walk alone.
And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead.
We cannot turn back.
There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, "When will you be satisfied?" We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality. We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities. We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one. We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating "for whites only." We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote. No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until "justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream."
I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. And some of you have come from areas where your quest -- quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive. Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed.
Let us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends.
And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."
I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.
I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.
I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
I have a dream today!
I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of "interposition" and "nullification" -- one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.
I have a dream today!
I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; "and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together."
This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to the South with.
With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood. With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.
And this will be the day -- this will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning:
My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing.
Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim's pride,
From every mountainside, let freedom ring!
And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true.
And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.
Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.
Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of
Pennsylvania.
Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.
Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.
But not only that:
Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.
Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee.
Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.
From every mountainside, let freedom ring.
And when this happens, when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual:
Free at last! Free at last!
Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!


中文译文
一百年前，一位伟大的美国人签署了《解放黑奴宣言》，今天我们就是在他的雕像前集会。这一庄严宣言犹如灯塔的光芒，给千百万在那摧残生命的不义之火中受煎熬的黑奴带来了希望。它之到来犹如欢乐的黎明，结束了束缚黑人的漫长之夜。
然而一百年后的今天，我们必须正视黑人还没有得到自由这一悲惨的事实。一百年后的今天，在种族隔离的镣铐和种族歧视的枷锁下，黑人的生活备受压榨；一百年后的今天，黑人仍生活在物质充裕的海洋中一个穷困的孤岛上；一百年后的今天，黑人仍然萎缩在美国社会的角落里，并且，意识到自己是故土家园中的流亡者。今天我们在这里集会，就是要把这种骇人听闻的情况公之于众。
就某种意义而言，今天我们是为了要求兑现诺言而汇集到我们国家的首都来的。我们共和国的缔造者草拟宪法和独立宣言时，曾以气壮山河的词句向每一个美国人许下了诺言，他们承诺给予所有的人以不可剥夺的生存、自由和追求幸福的权利。
就有色公民而论，美国显然没有实践她的诺言。美国没有履行这项神圣的义务，只是给黑人开了一张空头支票，支票上盖上“资金不足”的戳子后便退了回来。但是我们不相信正义的银行已经破产，我们不相信，在这个国家巨大的机会之库里已没有足够的储备。因此今天我们要求将支票兑现，这张支票——将给予我们宝贵的自由和正义的保障。
我们来到这个圣地也是为了提醒美国，现在是非常急迫的时刻。现在决非侈谈冷静下来或服用渐进主义的镇静剂的时候。现在是实现民主的诺言的时候。现在是从种族隔离的荒凉阴暗的深谷攀登种族平等的光明大道的时候，现在是向上帝所有的儿女开放机会之门的时候。
如果美国忽视时间的迫切性和低估黑人的决心，那么，这对美国来说，将是致命伤。自由和平等的爽朗秋天如不到来，黑人义愤填膺的酷暑就不会过去。1963年并不意味着斗争的结束，而是开始。有人希望，黑人只要撒撒气就会满足；如果国家安之若素，毫无反应，这些人必会大失所望的。黑人得不到公民的权利，美国就不可能有安宁或平静；正义的光明的一天不到来，叛乱的旋风就将继续动摇这个国家的基础。
但是对于等候在正义之宫门口的心急如焚的人们，有些话我是必须说的。在争取合法地位的过程中，我们不要采取错误的做法。我们不要为了满足对自由的渴望而抱着敌对和仇恨之杯痛饮。我们斗争时必须永远举止得体，纪律严明。我们不能容许我们的具有崭新内容的抗议蜕变为暴力行动。我们要不断地升华到以精神力量对付物质力量的崇高境界中去。
现在黑人社会充满着了不起的新的战斗精神，但是我们却不能因此而不信任所有的白人。因为我们的许多白人兄弟已经认识到，他们的命运与我们的命运是紧密相连的，他们今天参加游行集会就是明证；他们的自由与我们的自由是息息相关的。我们不能单独行动。
当我们行动时，我们必须保证向前进。我们不能倒退。现在有人问热心民权运动的人，“你们什么时候才能满足？”
只要黑人仍然遭受警察难以形容的野蛮迫害，我们就绝不会满足。
只要我们在外奔波而疲乏的身躯不能在公路旁的汽车旅馆和城里的旅馆找到住宿之所，我们就绝不会满足。
只要黑人的基本活动范围只是从少数民族聚居的小贫民区转移到大贫民区，我们就绝不会满足。
只要密西西比仍然有一个黑人不能参加选举，只要纽约有一个黑人认为他投票无济于事，我们就绝不会满足。
不！我们现在并不满足，我们将来也不满足，除非正义和公正犹如江海之波涛，汹涌澎湃，滚滚而来。
我并非没有注意到，参加今天集会的人中，有些受尽苦难和折磨；有些刚刚走出窄小的牢房，有些由于寻求自由，曾在居住地惨遭疯狂迫害的打击，并在警察暴行的旋风中摇摇欲坠。你们是人为痛苦的长期受难者。坚持下去吧，要坚决相信，忍受不应得的痛苦是一种赎罪。
让我们回到密西西比去，回到阿拉巴马去，回到南卡罗来纳去，回到佐治亚去，回到路易斯安那去，回到我们北方城市中的贫民区和少数民族居住区去，要心中有数，这种状况是能够也必将改变的。我们不要陷入绝望而不可自拔。
朋友们，今天我对你们说，在现在和未来，我们虽然遭受种种困难和挫折，我仍然有一个梦想。这个梦想是深深扎根于美国的梦想中的。
我梦想有一天，这个国家会站立起来，真正实现其信条的真谛：“我们认为这些真理是不言而喻的——人人生而平等。”
我梦想有一天，在佐治亚州的红色山岗上，昔日奴隶的儿子将能够和昔日奴隶主的儿子同席而坐，共叙手足情谊。
我梦想有一天，甚至连密西西比州这个正义匿迹，压迫成风的地方，也将变成自由和正义的绿洲。
我梦想有一天，我的四个孩子将在一个不是以他们的肤色，而是以他们的品格优劣来评价他们的国度里生活。
我今天有一个梦想。
我梦想有一天，亚拉巴马州能够有所转变，尽管该州州长现在仍然满口异议，反对联邦法令，但有朝一日，那里的黑人男孩和女孩将能与白人男孩和女孩情同骨肉，携手并进。
我今天有一个梦想。
我梦想有一天，幽谷上升，高山下降，坎坷曲折之路成坦途，圣光披露，满照人间。
这就是我们的希望。我怀着这种信念回到南方。有了这个信念，我们将能从绝望之嶙劈出一块希望之石。有了这个信念，我们将能把这个国家刺耳争吵的声，改变成为一支洋溢手足之情的优美交响曲。
有了这个信念，我们将能一起工作，一起祈祷，一起斗争，一起坐牢，一起维护自由；因为我们知道，终有一天，我们是会自由的。
在自由到来的那一天，上帝的所有儿女们将以新的含义高唱这支歌：“我的祖国，美丽的自由之乡，我为您歌唱。您是父辈逝去的地方，您是最初移民的骄傲，让自由之声响彻每个山冈。”
如果美国要成为一个伟大的国家，这个梦想必须实现。让自由之声从新罕布什尔州的巍峨峰巅响起来！让自由之声从纽约州的崇山峻岭响起来！让自由之声从宾夕法尼亚州阿勒格尼山的顶峰响起来！

https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1a54y1i7DR STEVE JOBS Stanford Commencement


English Speeches with Big Subtitles

I'm honored to be with you today for your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world.
Truth be told, I never graduated from college.
This is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation.
Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it!
No big deal. Just three stories.
The first story is about connecting the dots.
I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit.
So why did I drop out?
It started before I was born.
My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption.
She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife.
Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl.
So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: "We've got an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?"
They said: "Of course." 
My biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school.
She refused to sign the final adoption papers.
She only relented a few months later when my parents promised that I would go to college.
This was the start in my life.
And 17 years later I did go to college.
But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition.
After six months, I couldn't see the value in it.
I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out.
And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life.
So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK.
It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made.
The minute I dropped out
I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting.
It wasn't all romantic.
I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms, I returned coke bottles for the $0.05 deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple.
I loved it.
And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.
Let me give you on example: Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country.
Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed.
Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this.
I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great.
I was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating.
None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life.
But 10 years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me.
And we designed it all into the Mac.
It was the first computer with beautiful typography.
If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.
And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them.
If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do.
Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college.
But it was very, very clear looking backwards 10 years later.
Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards.
So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.
You have to trust in something, your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.
Because believing that the dots will connect down the road it'll give you the confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well-worn path and that will make all the difference.


My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky. I found what I loved to do early in life.
Woz and I started Apple in my parents' garage when I was 20.
We worked hard, and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees.
We had just released our finest creation the Macintosh a year earlier, and I had just turned 30.
And then I got fired.
How can you get fired from a company you started?
As Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well.
But then our visions of the future began to diverge and eventually we had a falling out.
When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him.
So at 30 I was out.
And very publicly out.
What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone,
and it was devastating.
I really didn't know what to do for a few months.
I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me.
I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly.
I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley.
But something slowly began to dawn on me.
I still loved what I did.
The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit.
I had been rejected, but I was still in love.
And so I decided to start over.
I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me.
The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything.
It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.
During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife.
Pixar went on to create the world's first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world.
In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple, and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance.
And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.
I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple.
It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it.

My third story is about death.
When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: "If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right."
It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?"
And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.
Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.
Because almost everything, all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure, these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.
Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.
You are already naked.
There is no reason not to follow your heart.
About a year ago I was diagnosed with cancer.
I had a scan at 7.30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas.
I didn't even know what a pancreas was.
The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months.
My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctor's code for prepare to die.
It means to try and tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the next 10 years to tell them in just a few months.
It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family.
It means to say your goodbyes.
I lived with that diagnosis all day.
Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor.
I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery.
I had the surgery an thankfully I'm fine now.
This was the closest I've been to facing death, and I hope it's the closest I get for a few more decades.
Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept: No one wants to die.
Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there.
And yet death is the destination we all share.
No one has ever escaped it.
And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life.
It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.
Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away.
Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.
Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.
Don't be trapped by dogma, which is living with the results of other people's thinking.
Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice.
And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.
They somehow already know what you truly want to become.
Everything else is secondary.
When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with his poetic touch.
This was in the late 1960's, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and polaroid cameras.
It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic, overflowing with neat tools and great notions.
Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its couse, they put our a final issue.
It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age.
On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous.
Beneath it were the words: "Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish."
It was their farewell message as they signed off. "Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish."
And I have always wished that for myself.
And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you. "Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish."
Thank you all very much.

Taylor Swift: Doctor of Fine Arts Singer, Songwriter, Musician, Producer, and Director

Put the candidate to the lectern.
Taylor swift. Blazing singer-songwriter, producer, director, actress, pioneering and influential advocate for artist rights, and philanthropist. You have brought joy and resolve to your hundreds of millions of fans throughout the world. One of the best selling music artists in history. You have crossed genres, demographics, age groups and borders of all kinds to touch lives around the globe. With nine original studio albums, two rerecorded studio albums, five extended plays, three live albums and 14 compilations, you have sold well over 100 million album units, earning awards and honors in every category. You have used the remarkable platform you earned to galvanize support for the equality act, to prevent discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. And you have spoken out, and you have supported initiatives to protect women and girls from harassment and sexual assault. You have donated significantly to victims of floods and tornadoes, for cancer research, literacy programs for children, and public education. You have fearlessly challenged the exploitation of music artists, and successfully championed their right to be compensated for their work.
Taylor swift, you are a role model across the world for your unprecedented talent and accomplishment, your fierce advocacy for protection of those facing discrimination, and your commitment to speaking out forcefully, eloquently and effectively on behalf of all artists. By virtue of the authority vested in me, I am pleased to confer upon you the degree of doctor of fine arts honoris causa. I am now pleased to introduce taylor swift, who will respond on behalf of the honorary degree recipient.
Hi, I'm Taylor. Last time I was in a stadium this size, I was dancing in heels and wearing a glittery leotard. This outfit is much more comfortable. I would like to say a huge thank you to NYU's chairman of the board of trustees, Bill Berkeley, and all the trustees and members of the board, NYU's President Andrew Hamilton, Provost Katherine Fleming, and the faculty and alumni here today who have made this day possible. I feel so proud to share this day with my fellow honorees Susan Hockfield and Felix Matos Rodriguez, who humble me with the ways they improve our world with their work.
As for me, I'm 90 percent sure the main reason I'm here is because I have a song called 22. And let me just say, I am elated to be here with you today as we celebrate and graduate new york university's class of 2022. Not a single one of us here today has done it alone. We are each a patchwork quilt of those who have loved us, those who have believed in our futures, those who showed us empathy and kindness, or told us the truth, even when it wasn't easy to hear, those who told us we could do it when there was absolutely no proof of that. Someone read stories to you and taught you to dream, and offered up some moral code of right and wrong for you to try and live by. Someone tried their best to explain every concept in this insanely complex world to the child that was you, as you asked a bazillion questions like how does the moon work and why can we eat salad, but not grass? And maybe they didn't do it perfectly. No one ever can. Maybe they aren't with us anymore. In that case, I hope you'll remember them today. If they are in this stadium, I hope you'll find your own way to express your gratitude for all the steps and missteps that have led us to this common destination. I know that words are supposed to be my thing, but I will never be able to find the words to thank my mom and dad, my brother austin, for the sacrifices they made every day so I could go from singing in coffee houses, to standing up here with you all today, because no words would ever be enough.
To all the incredible parents, family members, mentors, teachers, allies, friends and loved ones here today who have supported these students in their pursuit of educational enrichment, let me say to you now, Welcome to new youk. It's been waiting for you. I'd like to thank NYU for making me technically, on paper at least, a doctor. Not the type of doctor you would want around in case of an emergency. Unless your specific emergency was that you desperately needed to hear a song with a catchy hook and an intensely cathartic bridge section. Or if your emergency was that you needed a person, who can name over 50 breeds of cats in one minute. I never got to have a normal college experience per se. I went to public high school until 10th Grade and then finished my education doing homeschool work on the floors of airport terminals. Then I went out on the road for a radio tour, which sounds incredibly glamorous, but in reality it consisted of a rental car, motels and my mom and I pretending to have loud mother-daughter fights with each other during boarding, so no one would want the empty seat between us on southwest. As a kid, I always thought I would go away to college, imagining the posters I would hang on the wall of my freshman dorm. I even set the ending of my music video for my song love story at my fantasy imaginary college, where I meet a male model reading a book on the grass. And with one single glance, we realized we had been in love in our past lives, which is exactly what you guys all experienced at some point in the last four years, right? But I really can't complain about not having a normal college experience to you because you went to nyu during a global pandemic, being essentially locked into your dorms and having to do classes over Zoom. Everyone in college during normal times stresses about test scores, but on top of that, you also had to pass like a thousand covid tests. I imagine the idea of a normal college experience was all you wanted too, but in this case, you and I both learned that you don't always get all the things in the bag that you selected from the menu in the delivery surface. That is life. You get what you get. And as I would like to say to you wholeheartedly, you should be very proud of what you've done with it. Today you leave New York University and then go out into the world searching what's next, and so will I. so as a rule, I try not to give anyone unsolicited advice unless they ask for it. I'll go into this more later. I guess I have been officially solicited in this situation to impart whatever wisdom I might have to tell you things that have helped me so far in my life. Please bear in mind that I in no way feel qualified to tell you what to do. You've worked and struggled and sacrificed, and studied and dreamed your way here today. And so you know what you're doing. You'll do things differently than I did them and for different reasons. So I won't tell you what to do because no one likes that. I will, however, give you some life hacks. I wish I knew when I was starting up my dreams of a career and navigating life, love, pressure, choices, shame, hope and friendship. The first of which is life can be heavy, especially if you try to carry it all at once. Part of growing up and moving into new chapters of your life is about catch and release. What I mean by that is knowing what things to keep and what things to release. You can't carry all things, all grudges, all updates on your ex, all enviable promotions your school bully got at the hedge fund his uncle started. Decide what is yours to hold and let the rest go. Oftentimes the good things in your life are lighter anyway, so there's more room for them. One toxic relationship can outweigh so many wonderful simple joys. You get to pick what your life has time and room for. Be discerning. Secondly, learn to live alongside cringe. No matter how hard you try to avoid being cringe, you will look back on your life and cringe retrospectively. Cringe is unavoidable over a lifetime. Even the term cringe might someday be deemed cringe. I promise you, you're probably doing or wearing sonething right now that you will look back on later and find revolting and hilarious. You can't avoid it, so don't try to. For example, I had a phase where for the entirety of 2012, I dressed like a 1950s house housewife. But you know what? I was having fun. Trends and phases are fun. Looking back and laughing is fun. And while we're talking about things that make us squirm, but really shouldn't, I'd like to say I'm a big advocate for not hiding your enthusiasm for things. It seems to me that there is a false stigma around eagerness in our culture of unbothered ambivalence. This outlook perpetuates the idea that it's not cool to want it, that people who don't try are fundamentally more chic than people who do. And I wouldn't know because I've been a lot of things, but I've never been an expert on 'chic'. But I'm the one who's up here, so you have to listen to me when I say this. Never be ashamed of trying Effortlessness is a myth. The people who wanted it the least were the ones I wanted to date and be friends with in high school. The people who want it the most are the people I now hire to work for my company. I started writing songs when I was 12, and since then it's been the compass guiding my life, and in turn, my life guided my writing. Everything I do is just an extension of my writing, whether it's directing videos or a short film, creating the visuals for a tour, or standing on a stage, performing. Everything is connected by my love of the craft, the thrill of working through ideas and narrowing them down and polishing it all up in the end, editing, waking up in the middle of the night, throwing out the old idea because you just thought of a new or better one, or a plot device that ties the whole thing together. There's a reason they call it a hook. Sometimes a string of words just ensnares me, and I can't focus on anything until it's been recorded or written down. As a songwriter, I've never been able to sit still or stay in one creative place for too long. I've made and released 11 albums. And in the process, I've switched genre from country to pop, to alternative, to folk. And this might sound like a very songwriter centric line of discussion. But in a way, I really do think we are all writers and most of us write in a different voice for different situations. You write differently in your instagram stories than you do your senior thesis. You send a different type of email to your boss than you do your best friend from home. We are literary chameleons. And I think it's fascinating. It's just a continuation of the idea that we are so many things all the time. And I know it can be really overwhelming figuring out who to be and when, who you are now, and how to act in order to get where you want to go. I have some good news. It's totally up to you. I have some terrifying news. It's totally up to you. I said to you earlier that I don't ever offer advice unless someone asked me for it. And now I'll tell you why. As a person who started my very public career at the age of 15, it came with a price. And that price was years of unsolicited advice. Being the youngest person in every room for over a decade meant that I was constantly being issued warnings from older members of the music industry, media, interviewers, executives. And this advice often presented itself as thinly veiled warnings. See, I was a teenager at a time when our society was absolutely obsessed with the idea of having perfect young female role models. It felt like every interview I did included slight barbs by the interviewer about me one day running off the rails. And that meant a different thing to every person who said it to me. So I became a young adult while being fed the message that if I didn't make any mistakes, all the children of America would grow up to be perfect angels. However, if I did slip up,

https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1qx411s7AJ 里根就职演讲

If we look to the answer
as to why for so many years we achieved so much
prospered as no other people on Earth
It was because here in this land
We unleashed the energy and individual genius
of man to a greater extent
that has ever been done before
Freedom and the dignity of the individal have been more available
and assured here than in any other place on Earth
The price for this freedom at times has been high
but we have never been unwilling to pay that price
Those who  said that we are in a time when there are no heroes
they just don't know where to look
The sloping hills of Arlington National Cemetery
with its row upon row of simple white markers
bearing crosses or Stars of David
They add up to only a tiny fraction of the proce that has been paid for our freedom
Each on of those markers is a moument to the kinds of hero I spoke eaelier
Their lives ended in places called
Belleau Wood
The Argonne
Omaha Beach
Salerno
and halfway around the world on Guadalcandl
Tarawa
Pork Chop Hill
the Chosin Reservoir
and in a hundred rice paddies and jungles of a place called Vietnam
Under oone such marker lies a young man --Martin Treptow
who left his job in a small town barber in 1917
to go to France with the famed Rainbow Division
There on the western front
he was killed trying to carry a message between battalions under heavy artillery fire
We are told that on his body was found a diary
On the flyleaf under the heading "My Pledge" he has written these words:
America must win this war
Therefore, I will work, I will save, I will scarifice, I will endure
I will fight cheerfully and do my utonst
as if the issue of the whole struggle depended on me alone
We must realize that no arsenal or no weapon in the arsenals of the world
is so formidable as the will and moral courage courage of free men and women
It is a weapon our adversaries in today's world do not have It is a weapon that we as Americans do have
Let's that ne understood by those who practice terrorism and prey upon their neighbours
As for the enemies of freedom, those who are potential adversaries
they will be reminded that peace is the higjest aspiration of the American people
We will negotiate for it sacrifice it we will not surrender for it --now or ever
We are Americans!

https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1R2421P7Fo 经典演讲丨肯尼迪：我们选择登月（第417期）


We choose to go to the moon  John F.Kennedy

Mr. Vice President, Governor, Congressman Thomas, Senator Wiley, and Congressman Miller,
Mr. Webb, Mr. Bell, scientists, distinguished guests, and ladies and gentlemen:
I appreciate your president having made me an honorary visiting professor,
and I will assure you that my first lecture will be very brief.
I am delighted to be here, and I'm particularly delighted to be here on this occasion.
We meet at a college noted for knowledge, in a city noted for progress, in a State noted for strength, 
and we stand in need of all three, for we meet in an hour of change and challenge, 
in a decade of hope and fear, in an age of both knowledge and ignorance.
The greater our knowledge increases, the greater our ignorance unfolds.
Despite the striking face that most of the scientists that the world has ever known are alive and working today,
despite the fact that this Nation's own scientific manpower is doubling every 12 years
in a rate of growth more than three times that of our population as a whole,
despite that, the vast stretches of the unknown and the unanswered
and the unfinished still far outstrip our collective comprehension.
No man can fully grasp how far and how fast we have come,
but condense, if you will, the 50000 years of man's recorded history in a time span of but a half-century.
Stated in these terms, we know very little about the first 40 years,
except at the end of them advanced man had learned to use the skins of animals to cover them.
Then about 10 years ago, under this standard, man emerged from his caves to construct other kinds of shelter.
Only five years ago man learned to write and use a cart with wheels.
Christianity began less than two years ago.
The printing press came this year, and then less than two months ago,
during this whole 50-year span of human history, the steam engine provided a new source of power.
Newton explored the meaning of gravity.
Last month electric lights and telephones and automobiles and airplanes became available.
Only last week did we develop penicillin and television and nuclear power,
and now if America's new spacecraft succeeds in reaching Venus,
we will have literally reached the stars before midnight tonight.
This is a breathtaking pace, and such a pace cannot help
but create new ills as it dispels old, new ignorance, new problems, new dangers.
Surely the opening vistas of space promise high costs and hardships, as well as high reward.
So it is not surprising that some would have us stay where we are a little longer to rest, to wait.
But this city of Houston, this State of Texas, this country of the United States
was not built by those who waited and rested and wished to look behind them.
This country was conquered by those who moved forward--and so will space.
William Bradford, speaking in 1630 of the founding of the Plymouth Bay Colony,
said that all great and honorable actions are accompanied with great difficulties,
and both must be enterprised and overcome with answerable courage.
if this capsule history of our progress teaches us anything,
it is that man, in his quest for knowledge and progress, is determined and cannot be deterred.
The exploration of space will go ahead, whether we join in it or not,
and it is one of the great adventures of all time,
and no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in the race for space.
Those who came before us made certain that this country rode the first waves of the industrial revolutions,
the first waves of modern invention, and the first wave of nuclear power,
and this generation does not intend to founder in the backwash of the coming age of space.
We mean to be a part of it -- we mean to lead it.
For the eyes of the world now look into space, to the moon and to the planets beyond,
and we have vowed that we shall not see it governed by a hostile flag of conquest, but by a banner of freedom and peace.
We have vowed that we shall not see space filled with weapons of mass destruction,
but with instruments of knowledge and understanding.
Yet the vows of this Nation can only be fulfilled if we in this Nation are first, and, therefore, we intend to be first.
In short, our leadership in science and in industry, our hopes for peace and security,
our obligations to ourselves as well as others, all require us to make this effort,
to solve these mysteries, to solve them for the good of all men, and to become the world's leading space-faring nation.
We set sail on this new sea because there is new knowledge to be gained, and new rights to be won,
and they must be won and used for the progress of all people.
For space science, like nuclear science and all technology, has no conscience of its own.
Whether it will become a force for good or ill depends on man,
and only if the United States occupies a position of pre-eminence
can we help decide whether this new ocean will be a sea of peace or a new terrifying theater of war.
I do not say the we should or will go unprotected against the hostile misuse of space
any more than we go unprotected against the hostile use of land or sea,
but I do say that space can be explored and mastered without feeding the fires of war,
without repeating the mistakes that man has made in extending his writ around this globe of ours.
There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet.
Its hazards are hostile to us all.
Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation many never come again.
But why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal?
And they may well ask why climb the highest mountain?
Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas?
We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things,
not because they are easy, but because they are hard,
because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills,
because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept,
one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.
It is for these reasons that I regard the decision last year to shift our efforts in space from low to high gear
as among the most important decisions that will be made during my incumbency in the office of the Presidency.
In the last 24 hours we have seen facilities now being created for the greatest and most complex exploration in man's history.
We have felt the ground shake and the air shattered by the testing of a Saturn C-1 booster rocket,
many times as powerful as the Atlas which launched John Glenn,
generating power equivalent to 10000 automobiles with their accelerators on the floor.
We have seen the site where the F-1 rocket engines, each one as powerful as all eight engines of the Saturn combined,
will be clustered together to make the advanced Saturn missile,
assembled in a new building to be built at Cape Canaveral as tall as a 48 story structure,
as wide as a city block, and as long as two lengths of this field.
Within these last 19 months at least 45 satellites have circled the earth.
Some 40 of them were "made in the United States of America" and they were far more sophisticated
and supplied far more knowledge to the people of the world than those of the Soviet Union.
The Mariner spacecraft now on its way to Venus is the most intricate instrument in the history of space science.
The accuracy of that shot is comparable to firing a missile from Cape Canaveral
and dropping it in this stadium between the 40-yard lines.
Transit satellites are helping our ships at sea to steer a safer course.
Tiros satellites have given us unprecedented warnings of hurricanes and storms,
and will do the same for forest fires and icebergs.
We have had our failures, but so have others, even if they do not admit them.
And they may be less public.
To be sure, we are behind, and will be behind for some time in manned flight.
But we do not intend to stay behind, and in this decade, we shall make up and move ahead.
The growth of our science and education will be enriched by new knowledge of our universe and environment,
by new techniques of learning and mapping and observation,
by new tools and computers for industry, medicine, the home as well as the school.
Technical institutions, such as Rice, will reap the harvest of these gains.
And finally, the space effort itself, while still in its infancy,
has already created a great number of new companies, and tens of thousands of new jobs.
Space and related industries are generating new demands in investment and skilled personnel,
and this city and this State, and this region, will share greatly in this growth.
What was once the furthest outpost on the old frontier of the West
will be the furthest outpost on the new frontier of science and space.
Houston, your City of Houston, with its Manned Spacecraft Center,
will become the heart of a large scientific and engineering community.
During the next 5 years the National Aeronautics and Space Administration expects to double
the number of scientists and engineers in this area,
to increase its outlays for salaries and expenses to $60million a year;
to invest some $200 million in plant and laboratory facilities;
and to direct or contract for new space efforts over $1 billion from this Center in this City.
To be sure, all this costs us all a good deal of money.
This year's space budget is three times what it was in January 1961,
and it is greater than the space budget of the previous eight years combined.
That budget now stands at $5400 million a year--a staggering sum,
though somewhat less than we pay for cigarettes and cigars every year.
Space expenditures will soon rise some more, from 40 cents per person per week
to more than 50 cents a week for every man, woman and child in the United States,
for we have given this program a high national priority--
even though I realize that this is in some measure an act of faith and vision, for we do not now know what benefits await us.
But if I were to say, my fellow citizens, that we shall send to the moon, 240000 miles away from the control station in Houston,
a giant rocket more than 300 feet tall, the length of this football field, made of new metal alloys,
some of which have not yet been invented, capable of standing heat and stresses
several times more than have ever been experienced, fitted together with a precision better than the finest watch,
carrying all the equipment needed for propulsion, guidance, control, communications, food and survival,
on an untried mission, to an unknown celestial body, and then return it safely to earth,
re-entering the atmosphere at speeds of over 25000 miles per hour,
causing heat about half that of the temperature of the sun--almost as hot as it is here today--
and do all this, and do it right, and do it first before this decade is out--then we must be bold.
I'm the one who is doing all the work, so we just want you to stay cool for a minute.
However, I think we're going to do it, and I think that we must pay what needs to be paid.
I don't think we ought to waste any money, but I think we ought to do the job. And this will be done in the decade of the sixties.
It may be done while some of you are still here at school at this college and university.
It will be done during the trem of office of some of the people who sit here on this platform.
But it will be done. And it will be done before the end of this decade.
I am delighted that this university is playing a part in putting a man on the moon as part of a great national effort of the United States of America.
Many years ago the great British explorer George Mallory, who was to die on Mount Everest,
was asked why did he want to clime it. He said, "Because it is there."
Well, space is there, and we're going to climb it, and the moon and the planets are there,
and new hopes for knowledge and peace are there.
And, therefore, as we set sail we ask God's blessing on the most hazardous and dangerous and greatest adventure
on which man has ever embarked. Thank you.

https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1hJWse6EfT/ 2024/8/19拜登民主党大会演讲完整版,也许人生最后一次精彩发言,刚上舞台潸然泪下
https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1AKWheCEgS/ 拜登告別演説:你不能只在赢的时候,说爱你的国家

Joe Biden: You can't love your country only when you win.
Good morning. Good to see this cabinet and staff together. It's good to see you all, particularly good to see my granddayghter sitting in the front row here. For over 200 years, America has carried out the greatest experiment in self-fovernment in the history of the world. That's not hyperbole, that's a fact. We're the people. The people vote and choose their own leaders and they do it peacefully. And we're in a democracy, the will of the people always prevails. Yesterday, I spoke with President-elect Trump to congratulate him on his victory and I assured him that I'd direct my entire administration to work with his team to ensure a peaceful and orderly transition. That's what the American people deserve. Yesterday, I also spoke with Vice President Harris. She's been a partner and a public servant. She ran an inspiring campaign and everyone got to see something that I learned early on to respect so much, her character. She has a backbone like a ramrod. She has great character, true character. She gave her whole heart and effort and she and her entire team should be proud of the campaign they ran. You know, the struggle for the soul of America, since our very founding, has always been an ongoing debate and still vital today. I know for some people, it's a time for victory, to state the obvious. For others, it's a time of loss. Campaigns are contests of competing visions. A country chooses one or the other. We accept the choice the country made. I've said many times, you can't love your country only when you win. You can't love your neighbor only when you agree. Something I hope we can do, no matter who you voted for, is see each other not as adversaries, but as fellow Americans. Bring down the temperature. I also hope we can lay to rest the question about the integrity of the American electoral system. It is honest, it is fair, and it is transparent. And it can be trusted, win or lose. I also hope we can restore the respect for all our election workers who busted their necks and took rosks at the outset. We should thank them. Thank them for staffing voting sites, counting the votes, protecting the very integrity of the election. Many of them are volunteers who do it simply out of love for their country. And as they did, as they did their duty as citizens, I will do my duty as president. I'll fulfill my oath and I will honor the Constitution. On January 20th, we'll have a peaceful transfer of power here in America. To all our incredible staff, supporters, cabinet members, all the people who've been hanging out with me for the last four years, God love you as my mother would say, thank you so much. You put so much into the past four years. I know it's a difficult time. You're hurting. I hear you and I see you. But don't forget, don't forget all that we accomplished. It's been a historic presidency. Not because I'm president, because what we've done, what you've done, a presidency for all Americans. Much of the work we've done is already being felt by the American people, but the vast majority of it will not be felt-we felt over the next 10 years. We have a-we have legislation we passed. It's just only now just really kicking in. We're gonna see over a trillion dollars worth of infrastructure work done, changing people's lives in infrastructure work done, changing people's lives in rural communities and communities that are in real difficulty because it takes time to get it done. And so much more it's gonna take time, but it's there. The road ahead is clear, assuming we sustain it. There's so much, so much we can get done and will get done based the way the legislation was passed. And it's truly historic. You know, we're leaving behind the strongest economy in the world. I know people are still hurting, but things are changing rapidly. Together we've changed America for the better. Now we have 74 days to finish the term, our term. Let's make every day count. That's the responsibility we have to the American people. Look folks, you all know it in your lives. Setbacks are unavoidable, but giving up is unforgivable. Setbacks are unavoidable, but giving up is unforgivable. We all get knocked down, but the measure of our character, as my dad would say, is how quickly we get back up. Remember, a defeat does not mean we are defeated. We lost this battle. The America of your dreams is calling for you to get back up. That's the story of America for over 240 years and counting. It's a story for all of us, not just some of us. The American experiment endures. We're going to be okay, but we need to stay engaged. We need to keep going. And above all, we need to keep the faith. I'm so proud to have worked with all of you. I really mean it. I sincerely mean it. God bless you all. God bless America. And may God protect our troops. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

Donald Trump : Never Ever Give Up
Now, I want to take this opportunity to give you some advice. Over the course of your life you will find that things are not always fair. You will find that things happen to you that you do not deserve and that are not always warranted. But you have to put your head down and fight, fight, fight. Never, ever, ever give up. Things will work out just fine. Look at the way I've been treated lately especially by the media. No politician in history, and I say this with great surety, has been treated worse or more unfairly. You can't let them get you down. You can't let the critics and the naysayers get in the way of your dreams. I guess that's why I won, thank you. Adversity makes you stronger. Don't give in, don't back down, and never stop doing what you know is right. Nothing worth doing ever, ever, ever came easy. And the more righteous your fight, the more opposition that you will face. I've accomplished a tremendous amount in a very short time as president.

贫穷的本质
让我们从一个简单的问题开始:为什么穷人总是做出不好的决策?我知道这是一个残酷的问题,但是让我们看看数据.穷人借钱越多,积蓄越少,抽烟越多,锻炼越少,喝酒越多,饮食越不健康.为什么呢?标准的解释是由英国首相Margaret Thatcher总结的.她将贫穷称为“一种人格缺陷”简而言之,就是缺少一种品格.

我知道你们大部分人不会这么直接.但是,不止Thatcher夫人一个人持有这种观点————穷人之所以贫穷是因为他们自己有问题.一些人会认为穷人应该为他们自己的错误买单.另一些人会反驳,我们应该帮助他们去做正确的决定.但是潜在的假设是相同的:穷人一定有问题.如果我们能改变他们,如果我们能教他们去正确地生活,如果他们能听从我们的劝告.坦诚地说,长期以来,我也是这么认为的.然而,就在几年前,我才发现我对于贫困的一切看法都是错误的.


2
一切都源于一次偶然的机会,我发现了一篇由几位美国心理学家发表的文章.他们前往印度,跋涉8000英里,去进行一项有趣的研究.这是一个针对甘蔗种植者的实验.你们应该知道,农民们60%的年收入都来自于丰收之后.这意味着他们每年有一段时间相对贫穷另一段时间相对富裕.研究人员分别在丰收前和丰收后对农民们进行智商测试.他们随后的发现令我震惊.测试表明,农名们在丰收前的智商较低.在贫困中生活的结果就是————智商降低14点.现在,再讲一个能让你们彻底失眠的观点,甚至连酗酒也不管用.

几个月后,我听说普林斯顿大学的教授,该研究的作者之一Eldar Shafir将要来到我所在的荷兰.于是我们在阿姆斯特丹见面谈到了他那革命性的贫困新理论.我将这个理论总结为几个字:匮乏心态.当人们察觉到缺乏某种东西时他们的行为就会发生变化.无论这个“东西”是什么————缺时间, 缺钱或缺食物.


3
你们都知道这种感觉,当你有太多事情要做时,或者当你没吃早餐时你的血糖骤降.你满脑子都是你所缺乏的东西————你现在必须得吃的三明治（缺乏食物）,将在5分钟内开始的会议（缺少时间）或是必须于明天前支付的账单（缺钱）.这就导致你无法从长远的角度去思考.就像一台新电脑一次性运行10个庞杂的程序.它会变得越来越慢,出现错误.最终,死机了————不是因为它是一台坏电脑,而是因为它一次性要处理太多程序.穷人面临着同样的问题.他们做出不好的决定,不是因为他们是蠢人,而是因为他们生活在一个任何人都会做出愚蠢的决定的环境中.

瞬间我明白了为什么这么多反贫穷计划都不管用.贫穷不是因为知识匮乏.最近,一项针对201起金钱管理训练的有效性分析表明这种训练完全无效.请不要误解了我的意思————我不是说穷人不学无术————他们当然可以变得更加聪明.但这还不够.或者说,就像Shafir教授所说,“就像是刚开始教一个人游泳却立马把他们扔进波涛汹涌的大海.”


4
我仍然记得,我坐在那,困惑不解.教授的话给我带来了巨大的冲击————我们本应在几十年前就想明白.我的意思是说,这些心理学家不需要任何复杂的大脑扫描;他们只需要测量一下农民的智商,而智商测试在100多年前就发明出来了.事实上,我意识到我以前读过关于贫穷心理学的书籍.世界上最著名的作家之一George Orwell在1920年代曾亲身经历过贫穷.他在书中写到:“贫穷的本质,是摧毁未来.”他感叹道:“人们理所应当地认为当你的收入在贫困线以下时他们有权教导你并为你祈祷.”

如今,这些话仍然能引起共鸣.当然,最大的问题是:我们能做些什么?现代经济学家已经想出一些解决办法.我们可以帮助穷人做一些文书工作或者给他们发消息提醒他们支付账单.这种类型的解决办法颇受当代政客欢迎,主要是因为,这几乎没有成本.我认为,这种解决办法是这个时代的一个标签————我们往往只关注表象,却忽略深层原因.


5
试问:我们为什么不去改变穷人的生活环境?让我们回到前面提到的电脑类比:与其一直纠结于一点点改进软件,为什么我们不简单地直接增加一些额外的内存呢?这时,Shafir教授露出一副茫然的表情.几秒钟后,他说:“奥,我知道了.你的意思是你想给穷人发钱以根除贫困.额,当然,这是个好想法.但是,恐怕你在阿姆斯特丹提出的这种左翼政策的想法————在美国并不存在.”

但这真的是一个过时的左派想法吗?我记得我看到过一个以前的计划————由一些历史上重要的思想家提出.500多年前,哲学家Thmas More在他的著作“乌托邦”最先提及了这个计划.它的支持者遍布左翼和右翼,包括人权运动者Martin Luther King,及经济学家Milton Friedman.这个计划简单得不可置信:保障基本收入.什么意思呢?很简单.就是每月的补助金,保障基本开支:食物,住宿,教育.这是无条件给予的,没有人会告诉你如何去得到它,没有人会告诉你如何去使用它.


6
这个基本收入不是一种恩惠,而是一种权利这绝对不是什么见不得人的事.正如我对贫穷本质的理解一样.我止不住在想:这是我们一直都在期待的想法吗?它真的就这么简单吗?随后的三年中,我阅读了一切我能找到的关于基本收入的书籍.我研究了几十个遍布全球进行的实验,很快我发现了一个镇子的故事————真正根除了贫困.然而 ... 几乎没有人记得.

这个故事开始于加拿大Dauphin.1974年,这个镇子上的每个人都得到了基本收入保障金,没有人掉到贫困线以下.在实验的开始,一队研究学者空降在镇子上.在随后的四年,一切都很顺利.然而,新政府掌权,加拿大新内阁认为这项昂贵的实验没有任何意义.所以,很明显,没有足够的资金去支撑结果分析工作,学者们将这些文件打包装进2000个箱子里并带走.25年过去了,一位加拿大教授Evelyn Forget发现了这些记录.


7
三年间,她用尽各种方法对这些数据进行统计分析,不管何种方法,每一次的结果都是一样的:这是一个彻彻底底成功的实验.

Evely Forget发现在Dauphin,人们不仅变得更加富有,还变得更加聪明且健康.孩子们在学校的表现有了大幅度进步.就医率下降了8.5%.家庭暴力事件减少了,精神健康问题也减少了.而且人们都去工作.只有新晋母亲和学生们工作得少一些————学生们在学校的时间增加.从美国到印度,全球范围内,不计其数的其他实验也得到了相似的结论.

所以... 我得到了如下结论.当贫困出现时,我们这些富有的人,应该停止我们假装最了解穷人.我们应该停止给穷人们, 我们没见过的人们送去鞋子和泰迪熊.我们应该根除大张旗鼓式的专断官僚主义,我们可以把工资给那些应该受到帮助的穷人们.


8
因为,我认为,钱应该花在穷人们需要的地方而不是专家们认为他们需要的地方.想象一下有多少杰出的科学家, 企业家和作家,例如George Orwell,因为缺钱而陨落.想象一下,如果我们能一次性让所有人彻底摆脱贫困有多少能量和天赋能够被释放.我认为,保障基本收入是对人们的一项风险投资.而且我们不得不这么做,因为贫穷的代价太昂贵了.比如,让我们看看在美国用于儿童贫困的支出.每年估计有5000亿美元用于解决越来越高的卫生保健开支,越来越高的辍学率及越来越多的犯罪.现在看来,这是对于人类潜能的一种不可置信的浪费.

让我们讨论一下最关键的问题.我们是否能够承担基本收入保障?其实这比你们想象的要便宜得多.在Dauphin,政府给予人民最低收入补贴.这意味着只要你掉到贫困线以下你的收入就会提高.在这种情形下,据我们的经济学家最乐观的估计,净支出1750亿美金————美国军费支出的四分之一,全国GDP的百分之一————你就可以将美国所有的贫困人口拉至贫困线以上.


9
现在看来,这应该是我们共同的目标.前面所讲都是一些琐碎的想法和说服...现在到了最根本的新想法的时间,保障基本收入不仅仅是一个新政策.它还是关于对于“工作”本质的全面的再思考.就其意义而言,它不仅将解放穷人,还将解放我们其余的人.

现如今,成千上万的人认为他们的工作没有任何意义或并不重要.最近的一个针对142个国家共230000员工的问卷调查发现只有13%的员工真正热爱他们的工作.另一项调查发现英国37%的员工认为他们的工作根本没有存在的价值.就像Brad Pitt在搏击俱乐部中所说“我们总是在做着那些我们憎恨的工作,买着那些我们根本不需要的东西.”

现在,请不要误解我————在这里我不是说老师, 清洁工及看护工作者.如果他们停止工作,那麻烦可就大了.我是说那些所有的有着出色的履历, 拿着高薪水的专家们他们在社交网络中通过战略性的会议,并努力想出创造性毁灭的附加价值来赚钱.


10
或者类似的情况.让我们想象一下我们浪费了多少天分,仅仅因为我们告诉我们孩子们他们不得不为了生存而工作.或者,看看几年前在Facebook工作的一个数学天才抱怨的,“我这代最优秀的思想是考虑如何让人们点击更多的广告.”

我是一个历史学家.如果历史教给我们任何东西,那就是事情可以不一样.我们建立起我们的社会和经济不是只有一种方式.思想可以并且正在改变世界.我认为,特别是在过去几年,我们不能安于现状,这变得越来越明确了————我们需要新的想法.

我知道你们中的许多人对未来加剧的不平等, 仇外, 以及气候变化感到悲观.但是光知道我们反对什么是不够的.我们需要做些什么.Martin Luther King没有说,“我有一个噩梦.”


11
所以...这是我们梦想:我相信在未来,你工作的价值不由你赚的钱决定,而是由你传播的快乐和你创造的意义决定.我相信在未来,教育的目的不在于为一个无意义的工作做好准备,而在于为有意义的一生做好准备.我相信在未来,脱离贫困不是一项特权,而是我们应得的一项权利.所以有我们.有我们.我们进行研究,我们得到证据,我们创造意义.

现在,在Thomas More第一次描述基础收入500年之后以及在George Orwell发现贫穷的实质100年之后,我们需要改变我们的世界观,因为贫穷不是缺少一种人格.贫穷就是缺少金钱.

Poverty isn't a lack of character; it's a lack of cash
Rutger Bregman

I'd like to start with a simple question: Why do the poor make so many poor decisions? I know it's a harsh question, but take a look at the data. The poor borrow more, save less, smoke more, exercise less, drink more and eat less healthfully. Why? Well, the standard explanation was once summed up by the British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. And she called poverty "a personality defect." A lack of character, basically.

Now, I'm sure not many of you would be so blunt. But the idea that there's something wrong with the poor themselves is not restricted to Mrs. Thatcher. Some of you may believe that the poor should be held responsible for their own mistakes. And others may argue that we should help them to make better decisions. But the underlying assumption is the same: there's something wrong with them. If we could just change them, if we could just teach them how to live their lives, if they would only listen. And to be honest, this was what I thought for a long time. It was only a few years ago that I discovered that everything I thought I knew about poverty was wrong.


2
It all started when I accidentally stumbled upon a paper by a few American psychologists. They had traveled 8,000 miles, all the way to India, for a fascinating study. And it was an experiment with sugarcane farmers. You should know that these farmers collect about 60 percent of their annual income all at once, right after the harvest. This means that they're relatively poor one part of the year and rich the other. The researchers asked them to do an IQ test before and after the harvest. What they subsequently discovered completely blew my mind. The farmers scored much worse on the test before the harvest. The effects of living in povertym it turns out, correspond to losing 14 points of IQ. Now, to give you an idea, that's comparable to losing a night's sleep or the effects of alcoholism.

A few months later, I heard that Eldar Shafir, a professor at Princeton University and one of the authors of this study, was coming over to Holland, where I live. So we met up in Amsterdam to talk about his revolutionary new theory of poverty. And I can sum it up in just two words: scarcity mentality. It turns out that people behave differently when they perceive a thing to be scarce. And what that thing is doesn't much matter -- whether it's not enough time, money or food.


3
You all know this feeling, when you've got too much to do, or when you've put off breaking for lunch and your blood sugar takes a dive. This narrows your focus to your immediate lack -- to the sandwich you've got to have now, the meeting that's starting in five minutes or the bills that have to be paid tomorrow. So the long-term perspective goes out the window. You could compare it to a new computer that's running 10 heavy programs at once. It gets slower and slower, making errors. Eventually, it freezes--not because it's a bad computer, but because it has too much to do at once. The poor have the same problem. They're not making dumb decisions because they are dumb, but because they're living in a context in which anyone would make dumb decisions.

So suddenly I understood why so many of our anti-poverty programs don't work. Poverty is not a lack of knowledge. A recent analysis of 201 studies on the effectiveness of money-management training came to the conclusion that it has almost no effect at all. Now, don't get me wrong -- this is not to say the poor don't learn anything -- they can come out wiser for sure. But it's not enough. Or as Professor Shafir told me, "It's like teaching someone to swim and then throwing them in a stormy sea."


4
I still remember sitting there, perplexed. And it struck me that we could have figured this all out decades ago. I mean, these psychologists didn't need any complicated brain scans; they only had to measure the farmer's IQ, and IQ tests were invented more than 100 years ago. Actually, I realized I had about the psychology of poverty before. George Orwell, one of the greatest writers who ever lived, experienced poverty firsthand in the 1920s. "The essence of poverty," he wrote back then, is that it "annihilates the future." And he marveled at, quote, "How people take it for granted they have the right to preach at you and pray over you as soon as your income falls below a certain level."

Now, those words are every bit as resonant today. The big question is, of course: What can be done? Modern economists have a few solutions up their sleeves. We could help the poor with their paperwork or send them a text message to remind them to pay their bills. This type of solution is hugely popular with modern politicians, mostly because, well, they cost next to nothing. These solutions are, I think, a symbol of this era in which we so often treat the symptoms, but ignore the underlying cause.


5
So I wonder: Why don't we just change the context in which the poor live? Or, going back to our computer analogy: Why keep tinkering around with the software when we can easily solve the problem by installing some extra memory instead? At that point, Professor Shafir responded with a blank look. And after a few seconds, he said, "Oh, I get it. You mean you want to just hand out more money to the poor to eradicate poverty. Uh, sure, that'd be great. But I'm afraid that brand of left-wing politics you've got in Amsterdam -- it doesn't exist in the States."

But is this really an old-fashioned, leftist idea? I remembered reading about an old plan -- something that has been proposed by some of history's leading thinkers. The philosopher Thomas More first hinted at it in his book, "Utopia," more than 500 years ago. And its proponents have spanned the spectrum from the left to the right, from the civil rights campaigner, Martin Luther King, to the economist Milton Friedman. And it's an incredibly simple idea: basic income guarantee. What it is? Well, that's easy. It's a monthly grant, enough to pay for your basic needs: food, shelter, education. It's completely unconditional, so no one's going to tell you what you have to do for it, and no one's going to tell you what you have to do with it.


6
The basic income is not a favor, but a right. There's absolutely no stigma attached. So as I learned about the true nature of poverty, I couldn't stop wondering: Is this the idea we've all been waiting for? Could it really be that simple? And in the three years that followed, I read everything I could find about basic income. I researched the dozens of experiments that have been conducted all over the globe, and it didn't take long before I stumbled upon a story of a town that had done it -- had actually eradicated poverty. But then ... nearly everyone forgot about it.

This story starts in Dauphin, Canada. In 1974, everybody in this small town was guaranteed a basic income, ensuring that no one fell below the poverty line. At the start of the experiment, an army of researchers descended on the town. For four years, all went well. But then a new government was voted into power, and the new Canadian cabinet saw little point to the expensive experiment. So when it became clear there was no money left to analyze the results, the researchers decided to pack their files away in some 2,000 boxes. Twenty-five years went by, and then Evelyn Forget, a Canadian professor, found the records.


7
For three years, she subjected the data to all manner of statistical analysis, and no matter what she tried, the results were the same every time: the experiment had been a resounding success.

Evelyn Forget discovered that the people in Dauphin had not only become richer but also smarter and healthier. The school performance of kids improved substantially. The hospitalization rate decreased by as much as 8.5 percent. Domestic violence incidents were down, as were mental health complaints. And people didn't quit their jobs. The only ones who worked a little less were new mothers and students -- who stayed in school longer. Similar results have since been found in countless other experiments around the globe, from the US to India.

So ... here's what I've learned. When it comes to poverty, we, the rich, should stop pretending we know best. We should stop sending shoes and teddy bears to the poor, to people we have never met. And we should get rid of the vast industry of paternalistic bureaucrats when we could simply hand over their salaries to the poor they're supposed to help.


8
Because, I mean, the great thing about money is that people can use it to buy things they need instead of things that self-appointed experts think they need. Just imagine how many brilliant scientists and entrepreneurs and writers, like George Orwell, are now withering away in scarcity. Imagine how much energy and talent we would unleash if we got rid of poverty once and for all. I believe that a basic income would work like venture capital for the people. And we can't afford not to do it, because poverty is hugely expensive. Just look at the cost of child poverty in the US, for example. It's estimated at 500 billion dollars each year, in terms of higher health care spending, higher dropout retes, and more crime. Now, this is an incredible waste of human potential.

But let's talk about the elephant in the room. How could we ever afford a basic income guarantee? Well, it's actually a lot cheaper than you may think. What they did in Dauphin is finance it with a negative income tax. This means that your income is topped up as soon as you fall below the poverty line. And in that scenario, according to our economists' best estimates, for a net cost of 175 billion -- a quarter of US military spending, one percent of GDP -- you could lift all impoverished Americans above the poverty line.


9
Now, that should be our goal. The time for small thoughts and little nudges is past. I really believe that the time has come for radical new ideas, and basic income is so much more than just another policy. It is also a complete rethink of what work actually is. And in that sense, it will not only free the poor, but also the rest of us.

Nowadays, millions of people feel that their jobs have little meaning or significance. A recent poll among 230,000 employees in 142 countries found that only 13 percent of workers actually like their job. And another poll found that as much as 37 percent of British workers have a job that they think doesn't even need to exist. It's like Brad Pitt says in "Fight Club," "Too often we're working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need."

Now, don't get me wrong -- I'm not talking about the teachers and the garbagemen and the care workers here. If they stopped working, we'd be in trouble. I'm talking about all those well-paid professionals with excellent resumes who earn their money doing ... strategic transactor peer-to-peer meetings while brainstorming the value add-on of disruptive co-creation in the network society.


10
Or something like that. Just imagine again how much talent we're wasting, simply because we tell our kids they'll have to "earn a living." Or think of what a math whiz working at Facebook lamented a few years ago: "The best minds of my generation are thinking about how to make people click ads."

I'm a historian. And if history teaches us anything, it is that things could be different. There is nothing inevitable about the way we structured our society and economy right now. Ideas can and do change the world. And I think that especially in the past few years, it has become abundantly clear that we cannot stick to the status quo -- that we need new ideas.

I know that many of you may feel pessimistic about a future of rising inequality, xenophobia and climate change. But it's not enough to know what we're against. We also need to be for something. Martin Luther King didn't say, "I have a nightmare."


11
So ... here's my dream: I believe in a future where the value of your work is not determined by the size of your paycheck, but by the amount of happiness you spread and the amount of meaning you give. I believe in a future where the point of education is not to prepare you for another useless job but for a life well-lived. I believe in a future where an existence without poverty is not a privilege but a right we all deserve. So here we are. Here we are. We've got the research, we've got the evidence and we've got the means.

Now, more than 500 years after Thomas More first wrote about a basic income, and 100 years after George Orwell discovered the true nature of poverty, we all need to change our worldview, because poverty is not a lack of character. Poverty is a lack of cash.

All three major stock indexes closed higher on Thursday after new federal data showed the United States’ economy grew by an estimated 2.5% over the course of 2023, defying widespread predictions that gross domestic product would rise by a languid 0.7%.



While economic output has slowed in recent months, investors’ growing optimism that the Fed will cut interest rates this year has helped power the stock market to record highs. The S&P 500 is up more than 2% at the start of this year, after jumping 26% last year. Now, many Americans whose only toehold in markets are their retirement accounts are getting in on the good times, too.

The average 401(k) balance rose to $107,700 by the third quarter of 2023, up 11% from the year before, according to the latest update from Fidelity Investments, one of the largest retirement plan providers in the nation. That growth appears to have encouraged many savers last year to sit back and relax as markets rose, rather than tinker with their allocations.



Human resources provider Alight found that net trading activity in 401(k) plans has quieted down, falling to a rate of 0.82% last year from 1.27% in 2022 — and down substantially from 3.51% in 2020, the year the pandemic slammed into markets.



The recent gains also lured account holders further into stocks, which comprised an average 70.5% of 401(k) portfolios by year’s end, up from 68.2% at the start of 2023, according to Alight data.




Of course, the stock market is hardly a mirror of the economy as a whole, with share prices rising and falling for many reasons unrelated to macroeconomic trends. And personal finance experts caution against checking your 401(k) balance in panic when markets plummet, or in jubilation when they soar. Retirement savings are meant to be held over the long term and typically reward the patient; the S&P 500 has risen 172% over the last decade, despite many short-term swings.



But for now, last year’s surprisingly strong economic growth has been a welcome development after a steady drumbeat of gloomy expectations.



“The outperformance was really driven by consumer spending that was much stronger than expected, and the main source of support for consumer spending was a resilient labor market,” EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said.



Retail spending, a litmus test for households’ budgets for goods (like apparel) and services (like dining out), rose 4.8% between December 2022 and December 2023. Despite worries that Americans had burned through cash built up during the pandemic, Thursday’s data showed personal savings expanding as a percentage of disposable income, to 4.5% in 2023 from 3.3% in 2022, driven by rising wages and a robust job market.



“If you have a job and if that job is still paying you well, relative to pre-pandemic, then it’s unlikely that you’re going to be seeing any form of recession,” Daco said.



Stock markets took off as companies dodged a much-feared nosedive in consumer activity, which accounts for about two-thirds of the economy. The S&P 500’s massive gains were largely driven by tech-heavy giants like Nvidia, Meta and Tesla, but smaller companies have also been cheered that households are still spending at a healthy clip.



While Wall Street analysts still broadly expect the stock market to keep rising, many foresee a softer year ahead.



“This does not mean growth will not slow further,” Moody’s Analytics Senior Director Scott Hoyt said in a note after the GDP data landed Thursday.



A recent Bloomberg survey found forecasters expect the S&P 500 to rise to 4,950 by year-end, a 3.8% upside from where the index ended last year. Recession risks haven’t evaporated, either. Some analysts warn that 2024 could see things sour for both the economy and the stock market — potentially imperiling those higher 401(k) figures.



BCA Research said in December that it expects the S&P to fall as much as 27% this year, predicting that the Fed’s rate hikes haven’t fully sunk in across the economy and will further pressure households as resumed student loan payments continue and high credit card rates bite.

“A slowdown in consumer spending is imminent,” the firm said. At the same time, the BCA analysts admitted they had “underestimated the strength of the U.S. consumer coming into 2023.”
